Bugfix
   * Fix TLS connections failing when the handshake selects TLS 1.3
     in an application that does not call psa_crypto_init().
     Fixes #9072.

Changes
   * A TLS handshake may now call psa_crypto_init() if TLS 1.3 is enabled.
     This can happen even if TLS 1.3 is offered but eventually not selected
     in the protocol version negotiation.
