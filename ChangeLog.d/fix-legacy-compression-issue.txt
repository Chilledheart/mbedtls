Bugfix
   * Fix an issue where TLS 1.2 clients who send a ClientHello message with
     legacy_compression_methods get a failure in connection because TLS 1.3
     is enabled by default and the server rejects the ClientHello packet as
     malformed for TLS 1.3 in a way that stops the fallback to TLS 1.2.
     fixes #8995, #9243.
