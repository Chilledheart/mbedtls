Bugfix
   * Fix an issue where ssl_tls13_parse_client_hello() assumed legacy_compression_methods
     length would always be zero, which is true for TLS 1.3. However, with TLS 1.3 enabled
     by default, all ClientHello requests (including TLS 1.2 requests) are initially
     processed by ssl_tls13_parse_client_hello() before being passed to the TLS 1.2
     parsing function. This caused an issue where legacy_compression_methods
     might not be zero for TLS 1.2 requests, as it is processed earlier.
